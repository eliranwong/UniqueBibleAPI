            '(John 3:16) For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his '
            'one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not '
            'perish but have eternal life.\n'
            '(Rom 5:8) But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while '
            'we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\n'
            '(1John 4:9-10) 9 By this the love of God is revealed in us: that '
            'God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may '
            'live through him. 10 In this is love: not that we have loved God, '
            'but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice '
            'for our sins.\n'
            '(John 3:15) so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal '
            'life.”\n'
            '(John 11:25-26) 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and '
            'the life. The one who believes in me will live even if he dies, '
            '26 and the one who lives and believes in me will never die. Do '
            'you believe this?”\n'
            '(John 6:40) For this is the will of my Father – for everyone who '
            'looks on the Son and believes in him to have eternal life, and I '
            'will raise him up at the last day.”\n'
            '(Rom 8:32) Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him '
            'up for us all – how will he not also, along with him, freely give '
            'us all things?\n'
            '(John 3:36) The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The '
            'one who rejects the Son will not see life, but God’s wrath '
            'remains on him.\n'
            '(1John 4:19) We love because he loved us first.\n'
            '(John 10:28) I give them eternal life, and they will never '
            'perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.\n'
            '(1Tim 1:15-16) 15 This saying is trustworthy and deserves full '
            'acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners” – '
            'and I am the worst of them! 16 But here is why I was treated with '
            'mercy: so that in me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate '
            'his utmost patience, as an example for those who are going to '
            'believe in him for eternal life.\n'
            '(Rom 5:10) For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God '
            'through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been '
            'reconciled, will we be saved by his life?\n'
            '(John 1:29) On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and '
            'said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the '
            'world!\n'
            '(2Cor 5:19-21) 19 In other words, in Christ God was reconciling '
            'the world to himself, not counting people’s trespasses against '
            'them, and he has given us the message of reconciliation. 20 '
            'Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were '
            'making his plea through us. We plead with you on Christ’s behalf, '
            '“Be reconciled to God!” 21 God made the one who did not know sin '
            'to be sin for us, so that in him we would become the '
            'righteousness of God.\n'
            '(2Thess 2:16) Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our '
            'Father, who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and '
            'good hope,\n'
            '(Gen 22:12) “Do not harm the boy!” the angel said. “Do not do '
            'anything to him, for now I know that you fear God because you did '
            'not withhold your son, your only son, from me.”\n'
            '(Eph 2:4) But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love '
            'with which he loved us,\n'
            '(Rev 1:5) and from Jesus Christ – the faithful witness, the '
            'firstborn from among the dead, the ruler over the kings of the '
            'earth. To the one who loves us and has set us free from our sins '
            'at the cost of his own blood\n'
            '(Matt 9:13) Go and learn what this saying means: ‘I want mercy '
            'and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but '
            'sinners.”\n'
            '(John 1:18) No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, '
            'who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God '
            'known.\n'
            '(Titus 3:4) But “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love '
            'for mankind appeared,\n'
            '(John 1:14) Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among '
            'us. We saw his glory – the glory of the one and only, full of '
            'grace and truth, who came from the Father.\n'
            '(Mark 12:6) He had one left, his one dear son. Finally he sent '
            'him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’\n'
            '(Luke 2:14) “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace '
            'among people with whom he is pleased!”\n'
