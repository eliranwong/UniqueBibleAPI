            '# Conversation with Nicodemus\n'
            '1 Now a certain man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a member '
            'of the Jewish ruling council, 2 came to Jesus at night and said '
            'to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from '
            'God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do '
            'unless God is with him.” 3 Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn '
            'truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the '
            'kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born '
            'when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a '
            'second time, can he?”\n'
            '5 Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person '
            'is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. '
            '6 What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the '
            'Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You '
            'must all be born from above.’ 8 The wind blows wherever it will, '
            'and you hear the sound it makes, but do not know where it comes '
            'from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of '
            'the Spirit.”\n'
            '9 Nicodemus replied, “How can these things be?” 10 Jesus '
            'answered, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t '
            'understand these things? 11 I tell you the solemn truth, we speak '
            'about what we know and testify about what we have seen, but you '
            'people do not accept our testimony. 12 If I have told you people '
            'about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe '
            'if I tell you about heavenly things? 13 No one has ascended into '
            'heaven except the one who descended from heaven – the Son of Man. '
            '14 Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must '
            'the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 so that everyone who believes in '
            'him may have eternal life.”\n'
            '16 For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and '
            'only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish '
            'but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the '
            'world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved '
            'through him. 18 The one who believes in him is not condemned. The '
            'one who does not believe has been condemned already, because he '
            'has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. 19 '
            'Now this is the basis for judging: that the light has come into '
            'the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light, '
            'because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone who does evil '
            'deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that '
            'their deeds will not be exposed. 21 But the one who practices the '
            'truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that '
            'his deeds have been done in God.\n'
            '# Further Testimony About Jesus by John the Baptist\n'
            '22 After this, Jesus and his disciples came into Judean '
            'territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing. '
            '23 John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was '
            'plentiful there, and people were coming to him and being '
            'baptized. 24 (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)\n'
            '25 Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and '
            'a certain Jew concerning ceremonial washing. 26 So they came to '
            'John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you on the '
            'other side of the Jordan River, about whom you testified – see, '
            'he is baptizing, and everyone is flocking to him!”\n'
            '27 John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been '
            'given to him from heaven. 28 You yourselves can testify that I '
            'said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before '
            'him.’ 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend '
            'of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices '
            'greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This then is my '
            'joy, and it is complete. 30 He must become more important while I '
            'become less important.”\n'
            '31 The one who comes from above is superior to all. The one who '
            'is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly '
            'things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to all. 32 He '
            'testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts '
            'his testimony. 33 The one who has accepted his testimony has '
            'confirmed clearly that God is truthful. 34 For the one whom God '
            'has sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit '
            'sparingly. 35 The Father loves the Son and has placed all things '
            'under his authority. 36 The one who believes in the Son has '
            'eternal life. The one who rejects the Son will not see life, but '
            'God’s wrath remains on him.',
