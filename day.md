{'content': '(Job 25:1-6) 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered: 2 “Dominion and '
            'awesome might belong to God; he establishes peace in his heights. '
            '3 Can his armies be numbered? On whom does his light not rise? 4 '
            'How then can a human being be righteous before God? How can one '
            'born of a woman be pure? 5 If even the moon is not bright, and '
            'the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned, 6 how much less '
            'a mortal man, who is but a maggot – a son of man, who is only a '
            'worm!”\n'
            '(Job 26:1-14) 1 Then Job replied: 2 “How you have helped the '
            'powerless! How you have saved the person who has no strength! 3 '
            'How you have advised the one without wisdom, and abundantly '
            'revealed your insight! 4 To whom did you utter these words? And '
            'whose spirit has come forth from your mouth? 5 “The dead tremble '
            '– those beneath the waters and all that live in them. 6 The '
            'underworld is naked before God; the place of destruction lies '
            'uncovered. 7 He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; '
            'he suspends the earth on nothing. 8 He locks the waters in his '
            'clouds, and the clouds do not burst with the weight of them. 9 He '
            'conceals the face of the full moon, shrouding it with his clouds. '
            '10 He marks out the horizon on the surface of the waters as a '
            'boundary between light and darkness. 11 The pillars of the '
            'heavens tremble and are amazed at his rebuke. 12 By his power he '
            'stills the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab the great sea monster '
            'to pieces. 13 By his breath the skies became fair; his hand '
            'pierced the fleeing serpent. 14 Indeed, these are but the outer '
            'fringes of his ways! How faint is the whisper we hear of him! But '
            'who can understand the thunder of his power?”\n'
            '(Job 27:1-23) 1 And Job took up his discourse again: 2 “As surely '
            'as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has '
            'made my life bitter – 3 for while my spirit is still in me, and '
            'the breath from God is in my nostrils, 4 my lips will not speak '
            'wickedness, and my tongue will whisper no deceit. 5 I will never '
            'declare that you three are in the right; until I die, I will not '
            'set aside my integrity! 6 I will maintain my righteousness and '
            'never let it go; my conscience will not reproach me for as long '
            'as I live. 7 “May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like '
            'the unrighteous. 8 For what hope does the godless have when he is '
            'cut off, when God takes away his life? 9 Does God listen to his '
            'cry when distress overtakes him? 10 Will he find delight in the '
            'Almighty? Will he call out to God at all times? 11 I will teach '
            'you about the power of God; What is on the Almighty’s mind I will '
            'not conceal. 12 If you yourselves have all seen this, Why in the '
            'world do you continue this meaningless talk? 13 This is the '
            'portion of the wicked man allotted by God, the inheritance that '
            'evildoers receive from the Almighty. 14 If his children increase '
            '– it is for the sword! His offspring never have enough to eat. 15 '
            'Those who survive him are buried by the plague, and their widows '
            'do not mourn for them. 16 If he piles up silver like dust and '
            'stores up clothing like mounds of clay, 17 what he stores up a '
            'righteous man will wear, and an innocent man will inherit his '
            'silver. 18 The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon, '
            'like a hut that a watchman has made. 19 He goes to bed wealthy, '
            'but will do so no more. When he opens his eyes, it is all gone. '
            '20 Terrors overwhelm him like a flood; at night a whirlwind '
            'carries him off. 21 The east wind carries him away, and he is '
            'gone; it sweeps him out of his place. 22 It hurls itself against '
            'him without pity as he flees headlong from its power. 23 It claps '
            'its hands at him in derision and hisses him away from his place.\n'
            '(Job 28:1-28) 1 “Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place '
            'where gold is refined. 2 Iron is taken from the ground, and rock '
            'is poured out as copper. 3 Man puts an end to the darkness; he '
            'searches the farthest recesses for the ore in the deepest '
            'darkness. 4 Far from where people live he sinks a shaft, in '
            'places travelers have long forgotten, far from other people he '
            'dangles and sways. 5 The earth, from which food comes, is '
            'overturned below as though by fire; 6 a place whose stones are '
            'sapphires and which contains dust of gold; 7 a hidden path no '
            'bird of prey knows – no falcon’s eye has spotted it. 8 Proud '
            'beasts have not set foot on it, and no lion has passed along it. '
            '9 On the flinty rock man has set to work with his hand; he has '
            'overturned mountains at their bases. 10 He has cut out channels '
            'through the rocks; his eyes have spotted every precious thing. 11 '
            'He has searched the sources of the rivers and what was hidden he '
            'has brought into the light. 12 “But wisdom – where can it be '
            'found? Where is the place of understanding? 13 Mankind does not '
            'know its place; it cannot be found in the land of the living. 14 '
            'The deep says, ‘It is not with me.’ And the sea says, ‘It is not '
            'with me.’ 15 Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it, nor '
            'can its price be weighed out in silver. 16 It cannot be measured '
            'out for purchase with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or '
            'sapphires. 17 Neither gold nor crystal can be compared with it, '
            'nor can a vase of gold match its worth. 18 Of coral and jasper no '
            'mention will be made; the price of wisdom is more than pearls. 19 '
            'The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it; it cannot be '
            'purchased with pure gold. 20 “But wisdom – where does it come '
            'from? Where is the place of understanding? 21 For it has been '
            'hidden from the eyes of every living creature, and from the birds '
            'of the sky it has been concealed. 22 Destruction and Death say, '
            '‘With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be '
            'found.’ 23 God understands the way to it, and he alone knows its '
            'place. 24 For he looks to the ends of the earth and observes '
            'everything under the heavens. 25 When he made the force of the '
            'wind and measured the waters with a gauge, 26 when he imposed a '
            'limit for the rain, and a path for the thunderstorm, 27 then he '
            'looked at wisdom and assessed its value; he established it and '
            'examined it closely. 28 And he said to mankind, ‘The fear of the '
            'Lord – that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is '
            'understanding.’”\n'
            '(Job 29:1-25) 1 Then Job continued his speech: 2 “O that I could '
            'be as I was in the months now gone, in the days when God watched '
            'over me, 3 when he caused his lamp to shine upon my head, and by '
            'his light I walked through darkness; 4 just as I was in my most '
            'productive time, when God’s intimate friendship was experienced '
            'in my tent, 5 when the Almighty was still with me and my children '
            'were around me; 6 when my steps were bathed with butter and the '
            'rock poured out for me streams of olive oil! 7 When I went out to '
            'the city gate and secured my seat in the public square, 8 the '
            'young men would see me and step aside, and the old men would get '
            'up and remain standing; 9 the chief men refrained from talking '
            'and covered their mouths with their hands; 10 the voices of the '
            'nobles fell silent, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their '
            'mouths. 11 “As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me, '
            'and when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me, 12 for I '
            'rescued the poor who cried out for help, and the orphan who had '
            'no one to assist him; 13 the blessing of the dying man descended '
            'on me, and I made the widow’s heart rejoice; 14 I put on '
            'righteousness and it clothed me, my just dealing was like a robe '
            'and a turban; 15 I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame; '
            '16 I was a father to the needy, and I investigated the case of '
            'the person I did not know; 17 I broke the fangs of the wicked, '
            'and made him drop his prey from his teeth. 18 “Then I thought, ‘I '
            'will die in my own home, my days as numerous as the grains of '
            'sand. 19 My roots reach the water, and the dew lies on my '
            'branches all night long. 20 My glory will always be fresh in me, '
            'and my bow ever new in my hand.’ 21 “People listened to me and '
            'waited silently; they kept silent for my advice. 22 After I had '
            'spoken, they did not respond; my words fell on them drop by drop. '
            '23 They waited for me as people wait for the rain, and they '
            'opened their mouths as for the spring rains. 24 If I smiled at '
            'them, they hardly believed it; and they did not cause the light '
            'of my face to darken. 25 I chose the way for them and sat as '
            'their chief; I lived like a king among his troops; I was like one '
            'who comforts mourners.\n'
            '(Matt 21:33-46) 33 “Listen to another parable: There was a '
            'landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a '
            'pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it '
            'to tenant farmers and went on a journey. 34 When the harvest time '
            'was near, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his '
            'portion of the crop. 35 But the tenants seized his slaves, beat '
            'one, killed another, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other '
            'slaves, more than the first, and they treated them the same way. '
            '37 Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my '
            'son.’ 38 But when the tenants saw the son, they said to '
            'themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and get his '
            'inheritance!’ 39 So they seized him, threw him out of the '
            'vineyard, and killed him. 40 Now when the owner of the vineyard '
            'comes, what will he do to those tenants?” 41 They said to him, '
            '“He will utterly destroy those evil men! Then he will lease the '
            'vineyard to other tenants who will give him his portion at the '
            'harvest.” 42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the '
            'scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the '
            'cornerstone. This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our '
            'eyes’? 43 For this reason I tell you that the kingdom of God will '
            'be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its '
            'fruit. 44 The one who falls on this stone will be broken to '
            'pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.” 45 When '
            'the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they '
            'realized that he was speaking about them. 46 They wanted to '
            'arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the '
            'crowds regarded him as a prophet.\n'
            '(Matt 22:1-14) 1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 '
            '“The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who gave a '
            'wedding banquet for his son. 3 He sent his slaves to summon those '
            'who had been invited to the banquet, but they would not come. 4 '
            'Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been '
            'invited, “Look! The feast I have prepared for you is ready. My '
            'oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is '
            'ready. Come to the wedding banquet.”’ 5 But they were indifferent '
            'and went away, one to his farm, another to his business. 6 The '
            'rest seized his slaves, insolently mistreated them, and killed '
            'them. 7 The king was furious! He sent his soldiers, and they put '
            'those murderers to death and set their city on fire. 8 Then he '
            'said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but the ones who had '
            'been invited were not worthy. 9 So go into the main streets and '
            'invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’ 10 And those '
            'slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found, '
            'both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. '
            '11 But when the king came in to see the wedding guests, he saw a '
            'man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12 And he said to '
            'him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ '
            'But he had nothing to say. 13 Then the king said to his '
            'attendants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the '
            'outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of '
            'teeth!’ 14 For many are called, but few are chosen.”\n'
            '(Ps 18:7-15) 7 The earth heaved and shook; the roots of the '
            'mountains trembled; they heaved because he was angry. 8 Smoke '
            'ascended from his nose; fire devoured as it came from his mouth; '
            'he hurled down fiery coals. 9 He made the sky sink as he '
            'descended; a thick cloud was under his feet. 10 He mounted a '
            'winged angel and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind. 11 He '
            'shrouded himself in darkness, in thick rain clouds. 12 From the '
            'brightness in front of him came hail and fiery coals. 13 The Lord '
            'thundered in the sky; the Most High shouted. 14 He shot his '
            'arrows and scattered them, many lightning bolts and routed them. '
            '15 The depths of the sea were exposed; the inner regions of the '
            'world were uncovered by your battle cry, Lord, by the powerful '
            'breath from your nose.',
