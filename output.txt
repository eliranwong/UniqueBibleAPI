            'Woman, what have I to do with thee? ] S. John alone of all the '
            'Evangelists never gives the Virgin’s name. Here, as so often, he '
            'assumes that his readers know the main points in the Gospel '
            'narrative: or it may be part of the reserve which he exhibits '
            'with regard to all that nearly concerns himself. Christ’s Mother '
            'had become his mother (Joh 19:26-27). He nowhere mentions his '
            'brother James.\n'
            '\n'
            'Treatises have been written to shew that these words do not '
            'contain a rebuke; for if Christ here rebukes His Mother, it '
            'cannot be maintained that she is immaculate. ‘Woman’ of course '
            'implies no rebuke; the Greek might more fairly be rendered ‘Lady’ '
            '(comp. Joh 19:26), At the same time it marks a difference between '
            'the Divine Son and the earthly parent: He does not say, ‘Mother.’ '
            'But ‘what have I to do with thee?’ does imply rebuke, as is '
            'evident from the other passages where the phrase occurs, Jdg '
            '11:12; 1Ki 17:18; 2Ki 3:13; Mat 8:29; Mar 1:24; Luk 8:28. Only in '
            'one passage does the meaning seem to vary: in 2Ch 35:21 the '
            'question seems to mean ‘why need we quarrel?’ rather than ‘what '
            'have we in common?’ But such a meaning, if possible there, would '
            'be quite inappropriate here. The further question has been '
            'asked,—what was she rebuked for? Chrysostom thinks for vanity; '
            'she wished to glorify herself through her Son. More probably for '
            'interference: He will help, but in His own way, and in His own '
            'time. Comp. Luk 2:51.\n'

            'mine hour ] The meaning of ‘My hour’ and ‘His hour’ in this '
            'Gospel depends in each case on the context. There cannot here be '
            'any reference to His death; rather it means His hour for '
            '‘manifesting forth His glory’ (Joh 2:11) as the Messiah by '
            'working miracles. The exact moment was still in the future. Comp. '
            'Joh 7:8, where He for the moment refuses what He soon after does; '
            'and Joh 12:23, Joh 17:1, which confirm the meaning here given to '
            '‘hour.’',
