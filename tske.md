            '(John 3:16) For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his '
            'one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not '
            'perish but have eternal life.\n'
            '(Luke 2:14) “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace '
            'among people with whom he is pleased!”\n'
            '(Rom 5:8) But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while '
            'we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\n'
            '(2Cor 5:19-21) 19 In other words, in Christ God was reconciling '
            'the world to himself, not counting people’s trespasses against '
            'them, and he has given us the message of reconciliation. 20 '
            'Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were '
            'making his plea through us. We plead with you on Christ’s behalf, '
            '“Be reconciled to God!” 21 God made the one who did not know sin '
            'to be sin for us, so that in him we would become the '
            'righteousness of God.\n'
            '(Titus 3:4) But “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love '
            'for mankind appeared,\n'
            '(1John 4:9) By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God '
            'has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live '
            'through him.\n'
            '(1John 4:10) In this is love: not that we have loved God, but '
            'that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for '
            'our sins.\n'
            '(1John 4:19) We love because he loved us first.\n'
            '(John 1:14) Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among '
            'us. We saw his glory – the glory of the one and only, full of '
            'grace and truth, who came from the Father.\n'
            '(John 1:18) No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, '
            'who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God '
            'known.\n'
            '(Gen 22:12) “Do not harm the boy!” the angel said. “Do not do '
            'anything to him, for now I know that you fear God because you did '
            'not withhold your son, your only son, from me.”\n'
            '(Mark 12:6) He had one left, his one dear son. Finally he sent '
            'him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’\n'
            '(Rom 5:10) For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God '
            'through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been '
            'reconciled, will we be saved by his life?\n'
            '(Rom 8:32) Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him '
            'up for us all – how will he not also, along with him, freely give '
            'us all things?\n'
            '(John 3:15) so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal '
            'life.”\n'
            '(Matt 9:13) Go and learn what this saying means: ‘I want mercy '
            'and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but '
            'sinners.”\n'
            '(1Tim 1:15) This saying is trustworthy and deserves full '
            'acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners” – '
            'and I am the worst of them!\n'
            '(1Tim 1:16) But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that in '
            'me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost '
            'patience, as an example for those who are going to believe in him '
            'for eternal life.\n'
            '(Gen 22:2) God said, “Take your son – your only son, whom you '
            'love, Isaac – and go to the land of Moriah! Offer him up there as '
            'a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will indicate to '
            'you.”\n'
            '(Deut 30:15) “Look ! I have set before you today life and '
            'prosperity on the one hand, and death and disaster on the other.\n'
            '(Ps 2:7) The king says, “I will announce the Lord’s decree. He '
            'said to me: ‘You are my son! This very day I have become your '
            'father!\n'
            '(Ps 36:7) How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race '
            'finds shelter under your wings.\n'
            '(Ps 40:10) I have not failed to tell about your justice; I spoke '
            'about your reliability and deliverance; I have not neglected to '
            'tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness.\n'
            '(Prov 8:4) “To you, O people, I call out, and my voice calls to '
            'all mankind.\n'
            '(Prov 8:24) When there were no deep oceans I was born, when there '
            'were no springs overflowing with water;\n'
            '(Prov 8:35) For the one who finds me has found life and received '
            'favor from the Lord.\n'
            '(Isa 9:6) For a child has been born to us, a son has been given '
            'to us. He shoulders responsibility and is called: Amazing '
            'Adviser, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n'
            '(Isa 51:6) Look up at the sky! Look at the earth below! For the '
            'sky will dissipate like smoke, and the earth will wear out like '
            'clothes; its residents will die like gnats. But the deliverance I '
            'give is permanent; the vindication I provide will not disappear.\n'
            '(Isa 55:4) Look, I made him a witness to nations, a ruler and '
            'commander of nations.”\n'
            '(Ezek 2:1) He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet and I '
            'will speak with you.”\n'
            '(Ezek 47:9) Every living creature which swarms where the river '
            'flows will live; there will be many fish, for these waters flow '
            'there. It will become fresh and everything will live where the '
            'river flows.\n'
            '(Zech 9:17) How precious and fair! Grain will make the young men '
            'flourish and new wine the young women.\n'
            '(Matt 7:11) If you then, although you are evil, know how to give '
            'good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in '
            'heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!\n'
            '(Matt 17:5) While he was still speaking, a bright cloud '
            'overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my '
            'one dear Son, in whom I take great delight. Listen to him!”\n'
            '(Matt 21:37) Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will '
            'respect my son.’\n'
            '(Matt 25:46) And these will depart into eternal punishment, but '
            'the righteous into eternal life.”\n'
            '(Matt 26:63) But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, '
            '“I charge you under oath by the living God, tell us if you are '
            'the Christ, the Son of God.”\n'
            '(Matt 27:43) He trusts in God – let God, if he wants to, deliver '
            'him now because he said, ‘I am God’s Son’!”\n'
            '(Mark 1:1) The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son '
            'of God.\n'
            '(Mark 1:11) And a voice came from heaven: “You are my one dear '
            'Son; in you I take great delight.”\n'
            '(Mark 9:7) Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from '
            'the cloud, “This is my one dear Son. Listen to him!”\n'
            '(Mark 16:16) The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, '
            'but the one who does not believe will be condemned.\n'
            '(Luke 1:78) Because of our God’s tender mercy the dawn will break '
            'upon us from on high\n'
            '(Luke 9:35) Then a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my '
            'Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!”\n'
            '(Luke 20:13) Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I '
            'do? I will send my one dear son; perhaps they will respect him.’\n'
            '(John 1:34) I have both seen and testified that this man is the '
            'Chosen One of God.”\n'
            '(John 3:36) The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The '
            'one who rejects the Son will not see life, but God’s wrath '
            'remains on him.\n'
            '(John 4:10) Jesus answered her, “If you had known the gift of God '
            'and who it is who said to you, ‘Give me some water to drink,’ you '
            'would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”\n'
            '(John 5:24) “I tell you the solemn truth, the one who hears my '
            'message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and '
            'will not be condemned, but has crossed over from death to life.\n'
            '(John 5:43) I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not '
            'accept me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will accept '
            'him.\n'
            '(John 6:29) Jesus replied, “This is the deed God requires – to '
            'believe in the one whom he sent.”\n'
            '(John 6:47) I tell you the solemn truth, the one who believes has '
            'eternal life.\n'
            '(John 6:51) I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If '
            'anyone eats from this bread he will live forever. The bread that '
            'I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”\n'
            '(John 7:29) but I know him, because I have come from him and he '
            'sent me.”\n'
            '(John 8:51) I tell you the solemn truth, if anyone obeys my '
            'teaching, he will never see death.”\n'
            '(John 10:28) I give them eternal life, and they will never '
            'perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.\n'
            '(John 14:4) And you know the way where I am going.”\n'
            '(John 20:31) But these are recorded so that you may believe that '
            'Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you '
            'may have life in his name.\n'
            '(Acts 16:31) They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you '
            'will be saved, you and your household.”\n'
            '(Rom 1:3) concerning his Son who was a descendant of David with '
            'reference to the flesh,\n'
            '(Rom 4:11) And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of '
            'the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still '
            'uncircumcised, so that he would become the father of all those '
            'who believe but have never been circumcised, that they too could '
            'have righteousness credited to them.\n'
            '(Rom 5:15) But the gracious gift is not like the transgression. '
            'For if the many died through the transgression of the one man, '
            'how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of '
            'the one man Jesus Christ multiply to the many!\n'
            '(Rom 8:39) nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation '
            'will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus '
            'our Lord.\n'
            '(1Cor 2:9) But just as it is written, “Things that no eye has '
            'seen, or ear heard, or mind imagined, are the things God has '
            'prepared for those who love him.”\n'
            '(2Cor 1:19) For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was '
            'proclaimed among you by us – by me and Silvanus and Timothy – was '
            'not “Yes” and “No,” but it has always been “Yes” in him.\n'
            '(2Cor 5:15) And he died for all so that those who live should no '
            'longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was '
            'raised.\n'
            '(2Cor 5:18) And all these things are from God who reconciled us '
            'to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of '
            'reconciliation.\n'
            '(2Cor 9:15) Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!\n'
            '(Gal 2:20) I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer '
            'I who live, but Christ lives in me. So the life I now live in the '
            'body, I live because of the faithfulness of the Son of God, who '
            'loved me and gave himself for me.\n'
            '(Gal 4:4) But when the appropriate time had come, God sent out '
            'his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,\n'
            '(Col 1:15) He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn '
            'over all creation,\n'
            '(Col 3:3) for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ '
            'in God.\n'
            '(2Thess 2:16) Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our '
            'Father, who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and '
            'good hope,\n'
            '(Titus 1:2) in hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, '
            'promised before time began.\n'
            '(Heb 1:2) in these last days he has spoken to us in a son, whom '
            'he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the '
            'world.\n'
            '(Heb 1:6) But when he again brings his firstborn into the world, '
            'he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him!”\n'
            '(Heb 2:3) how will we escape if we neglect such a great '
            'salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was '
            'confirmed to us by those who heard him,\n'
            '(Heb 2:9) but we see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels '
            'for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he '
            'suffered death, so that by God’s grace he would experience death '
            'on behalf of everyone.\n'
            '(Heb 5:5) So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high '
            'priest, but the one who glorified him was God, who said to him, '
            '“You are my Son! Today I have fathered you,”\n'
            '(Heb 10:39) But we are not among those who shrink back and thus '
            'perish, but are among those who have faith and preserve their '
            'souls.\n'
            '(Heb 11:17) By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up '
            'Isaac. He had received the promises, yet he was ready to offer up '
            'his only son.\n'
            '(1John 3:1) (See what sort of love the Father has given to us: '
            'that we should be called God’s children – and indeed we are! For '
            'this reason the world does not know us: because it did not know '
            'him.\n'
            '(1John 3:16) We have come to know love by this: that Jesus laid '
